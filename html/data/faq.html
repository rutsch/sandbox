		<p>
		Philips states in its mission that "we strive to make the world healthier and more sustainable through innovation. Our goal is to improve the lives of 3 billion people a year by 2025."
		</p>
		<p>
		In order to measure the lives improved by Philips, a detailed framework has been developed that is also validated by our accountants, KPMG, on an annual basis.
		</p>
		<p>
		"Lives improved" by Philips is the number of people that have been in touch with a selected number of our products; a Philips care-, green-, or well-being- product in a given year.
		</p>
		<p>
		To guide our efforts and measure our progress, we take a two-dimensional approach – social and ecological – to improving people’s lives. Products and solutions from our portfolio that directly support the curative (care) or preventive (well-being) side of people’s health, determine the contribution to the social dimension. As healthy ecosystems are also needed for people to live a healthy life, the contribution to the ecological dimension is determined by means of our Green Product portfolio, such as our energy-efficient lighting.

	<div class="faq_content" id="faq2content">
		<p>
		Philips Care Products are professional products and services that have a direct positive impact on a person’s health. At this moment, only products from the sector Healthcare fall in this category.

	<div class="faq_header" id="faq3" onclick="objExplain.showfaqcontent(this, 'faq3content')">What are Well-being products?</div>
	<div class="faq_content" id="faq3content">
		<p>
		Philips Well-being products and solutions enable people to live healthier lives. By this we mean providing consumers with tools to make healthier choices, e.g. when preparing food (Air fryer, Juicer, Blender); to care for their physical and mental health (Mother &amp; Childcare, Oral Health Care, Light therapy); to create a healthy home environment (Air purification). At this moment, only products from the sector Consumer Lifestyle fall in this category.

	<div class="faq_header" id="faq4" onclick="objExplain.showfaqcontent(this, 'faq4content')">What are Green products?</div>
	<div class="faq_content" id="faq4content">
		<p>
		Philips Green Products have proven best-in-class eco-performance as defined in the Philips Green Product definition. They offer a significant environmental improvement (>10%), or outperform product-specific eco-performance requirements (e.g. regulatory), or are rewarded with a recognized eco-performance label, and meet sector green product specific minimum requirements.

	<div class="faq_header" id="faq5" onclick="objExplain.showfaqcontent(this, 'faq5content')">What is double count?</div>
	<div class="faq_content" id="faq5content">
		<p>
		Double count refers to multiple different product touches per individual. For example one person may own a Philips Green LED lamp and a Philips Senseo Viva Café Eco, and undergo treatment by Philips Healthcare equipment; this person will only be counted once in the model instead of three times.
		</p>
		<p>
		Double count elimination is based on probability theory, i.e. the statistical likelihood for multiple product touches of one individual. For more information refer to the methodology document that can be found at <a href="http://www.annualreport2012.philips.com/downloads/pdf/Methodology_for_calculating_lives%20improved_2012.pdf" target="_blank">the Annual Report 2012 website</a>.

	<div class="faq_content" id="faq6content">
		<p>
		The Lives Improved app gives you the actual status of Lives Improved, this allows you to track progress against the targets that have been set. You can make a selection of organizational and geographical filters to get details that are relevant to you. 
		</p>
		<img src="img/slider_model.png" alt="" width="100%"/>
		<p>
		Furthermore, you can use the 'slider functionality' to estimate the number of Lives Improved at Year End. This enables you to see what is needed to reach your target.

<div class="faq_wrapper">
	<div class="faq_header" id="faq7" onclick="objExplain.showfaqcontent(this, 'faq7content')">How do the sliders work?</div>
	<div class="faq_content" id="faq7content">
		<p>
		The 'slider functionality' always calculates Lives Improved based on a full calendar year time frame, i.e. FY2013. The app uses YTD actual sales data and complements this with last year’s sales data for the remaining months in the current year to get a full calendar year worth of data.
		</p>
		<p>
		By moving the sliders you can see what happens to the Lives Improved when sales increases or decreases, or when Green Product Sales increases or decreases. These additional sales are assumed to be achieved in the still remaining part of the year.

	<div class="faq_content" id="faq8content">
		<p>
		The data in the app is updated on a monthly basis. This will be done in the week following the Month-end close.
