	<div class="faq_content" id="faq1content">
		<p>
		Philips states in its mission that "we strive to make the world healthier and more sustainable through innovation. Our goal is to improve the lives of 3 billion people a year by 2025."
		</p>
		<p>
		In order to measure the lives improved by Philips, a detailed framework has been developed that is also validated by our external auditors, KPMG, on an annual basis.
		</p>
		<p>
		'Lives improved' by Philips refers to the number of people whose lives have been touched by specific Philips products a Philips – Care, Green, or Well-being products – in a given year.
		</p>
		<p>
    To guide our efforts and measure our progress, we take a two-dimensional approach – social and ecological – to improving people's lives. Products and solutions from our portfolio that directly support the curative (care) or preventive (well-being) side of people's health, determine the contribution to the social dimension. As healthy ecosystems are also needed for people to live a healthy life, the contribution to the ecological dimension is determined by means of our Green Product portfolio, such as our energy-efficient lighting.

	<div class="faq_content" id="faq2content">
		<p>
		Philips Care products are professional products and services that have a direct positive impact on a person’s health. At this moment, only products from the Healthcare sector fall into this category.

	<div class="faq_content" id="faq3content">
		<p>
		Philips Well-being products and solutions enable people to live healthier lives. By this we mean providing consumers with tools to make healthier choices, e.g. when preparing food (Airfryer, Juicer, Blender); to care for their physical and mental health (Mother &amp; Childcare, Oral Healthcare, Light therapy); to create a healthy home environment (Air purification). At this moment, only products from the Consumer Lifestyle sector fall into this category.

	<div class="faq_content" id="faq4content">
		<p>
		Philips Green Products have proven best-in-class eco-performance, as defined in the Philips Green Product definition: they offer a significant environmental improvement (>10%), or outperform product-specific eco-performance requirements (e.g. regulatory), or have recieved a recognized eco-performance label, and meet specific sector requirements.

	<div class="faq_header" id="faq5" onclick="objExplain.showfaqcontent(this, 'faq5content')"><div class="number">5.</div><div class="text">What is 'double count'?</div></div>
	<div class="faq_content" id="faq5content">
		<p>
		Double count refers to multiple different product touches per individual. For example, one person may own a Philips Green LED lamp and a Philips Senseo Viva Café Eco, and undergo treatment by means of Philips Healthcare equipment; this person will only be counted once in the model instead of three times.
		</p>
		<p>
		Double-count elimination is based on probability theory, i.e. the statistical likelihood of one individual having multiple product touches. For more information, refer to the methodology document that can be found on <span class="mimiclink" onclick="loadUrlInBrowser('http://www.annualreport2012.philips.com/downloads/pdf/Methodology_for_calculating_lives%20improved_2012.pdf')">the Annual Report website</span>.

	<div class="faq_content" id="faq6content">
		<p>
		The Lives Improved app gives you the actual status of Lives Improved and allows you to track progress against the targets that have been set. You can make a selection of organizational and geographical filters to get details that are relevant to you. 
		</p>
		<p>
    Furthermore, you can use the simulator to see what kind of impact changes in sales and Green Sales percentage have on the next quarter Lives Improved results. This enables you to see what is needed to reach your target.

	<div class="faq_header" id="faq7" onclick="objExplain.showfaqcontent(this, 'faq7content')"><div class="number">7.</div><div class="text">How do the sliders work?</div></div>
	<div class="faq_content" id="faq7content">
		<p>
    The simulator always calculates Lives Improved for the next quarter-end. The app uses actual year-to-date data and supplements this with last year's sales data to determine trends and extrapolate data for the next quarter.
		</p>
		<p>
		By moving the sliders you can see what happens to the Lives Improved when sales increase or decrease, or when the Green sales percentage increases or decreases.
