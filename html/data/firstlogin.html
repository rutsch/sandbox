<h3>
What is Lives Improved?
</h3>
<p>
“Lives improved” by Philips is the number of people that have been in touch with either a Philips care-, green-, or well-being- product in a given year.
<br/>
At Philips, we strive to make the world healthier and more sustainable through innovation. Our goal is to improve the lives of 3 billion people a year by 2025. To guide our efforts and measure our progress, we take a two-dimensional approach – social and ecological – to improving people’s lives. Products and solutions from our portfolio that directly support the curative (care) or preventive (well-being) side of people’s health, determine the contribution to the social dimension. As healthy ecosystems are also needed for people to live a healthy life, the contribution to the ecological dimension is determined by means of our Green Product portfolio, such as our energy-efficient lighting.

The middle of the bar shows a trend graph, here you see the trend during the past year and the expected status at year end based on current sales growth estimations.
